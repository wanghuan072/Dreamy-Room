      Dreamy Room Level 21 transforms an empty space into a charming tropical campsite featuring a tall palm tree on the right, a pastel camper van with a ladder on the left, and two tents—a large yellow tent near the center-right and a smaller pastel tent beside the van. Colorful bunting flags stretch overhead, while a clothesline with hanging laundry adds a cozy touch in the back. A central campfire is surrounded by camping accessories like a guitar, small table with food, sleeping mat, and scattered stones. Ladders lean decoratively, and characters gather around the fire, creating a warm, inviting outdoor scene.
