          <h2>Dreamy Room Level 101 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
          <p>
            Dreamy Room Level 101 pushes your precision and spatial awareness to the next level. Starting on a bare sandy platform, 
            you’ll place palm trees, desert cacti, structural panels, and decorative accents to bring this desert-themed restaurant to life. 
            Each step focuses on correct snap-point orientation, ensuring every object clicks into place with satisfying accuracy.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 1: Palm Trees on Platform Edges</h3>
          <p>
            Begin with two palm trees positioned at opposite corners of the base. Rotate the camera to align trunks with the 
            subtle platform contours and listen for the snap sound confirming placement.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 2: Cacti Cluster</h3>
          <p>
            Distribute the perimeter cacti along designated notches. Alternate tall and short pieces to achieve a natural desert cluster effect.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 3: Central Pyramid Roof</h3>
          <p>
            Place the yellow-topped pyramid roof piece at the center notch of the platform, ensuring all corners align flush.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 4: Glass Window Facade</h3>
          <p>
            Insert the tall green-tinted glass panel into the west wall notch, locking it firmly into the base structure.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 5: Restaurant Sign & Emblem</h3>
          <p>
            Attach the fork-and-knife emblem above the entrance and secure the “Restaurant” script plaque in the front groove.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 6: Egyptian-Style Pillars</h3>
          <p>
            Position two ornate columns at the counter’s front corners. Rotate each to face inward for a balanced visual effect.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 7: Counter, Stools & Items</h3>
          <p>
            Place the red-and-white counter under the sign, then add two yellow bar stools and three countertop items: 
            a coffee cup, burger plate, and orange juice tumbler.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 8: Outdoor Table & Chairs</h3>
          <p>
            Snap the pink patio table into the terrace notch and surround it with four red chairs angled correctly for a lively dining scene.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 9: Staircase, Vending Machine & Extras</h3>
          <p>
            Align the staircase and adjacent red vending machine on the east face, then place the mummy figurine and fruit crate nearby.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 10: Rooftop Sphinx Ornament</h3>
          <p>
            For the finishing touch, install the black-and-yellow sphinx ornament on the pyramid’s roof apex, completing your desert-inspired eatery.

        <h2>Dreamy Room Level 103 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
          <p>
            Dreamy Room Level 103 challenges players to create an enchanting library scene, complete with a cozy attic, a spooky outdoor area, and friendly spectral inhabitants. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for every item placement, ensuring you get the perfect haunted aesthetic.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 1: Lay the Foundation and Walls</h3>
            Start by laying the dark gray grid-patterned tile floor, making sure it is flush with the bottom edge. Then, place the long white wall at the back and the shorter white wall on the left to form a perfect L-shaped corner.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 2: Place the Exterior Decorations</h3>
            <p>
                Add the gnarled black tree to the outside of the right wall, and arrange a cluster of gray stones around its base. On the left, place the wrought-iron fence segments, two weathered tombstones (one tilted), and scatter some bones for an eerie effect.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 3: Construct the Staircase and Attic</h3>
            <p>
                Position the wooden staircase against the back wall, aligning it with the floor tiles. Attach the wrought-iron railing to the stairs. Next, place the pink-shingled roof on the left side of the upper attic floor, then slot the arched window beneath the roof with emerald green curtains hanging from the rod.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 4: Install Interior Fixtures</h3>
            <p>
                Place the tall grandfather clock under the right side of the staircase, with its face pointing into the room. Position a potted plant to the left of the clock. Install the round white fireplace on the lower right wall and place the wine rack next to it, ensuring the bottles face outward.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 5: Arrange Shelves, Art, and Lighting</h3>
            <p>
                Center the tall wooden bookcase on the back wall to the left of the staircase. Decorate it with the globe on the top-left shelf, the gramophone on the top-right shelf, and the golden hourglass on the middle-right shelf. Above the fireplace, mount the large central portrait with the smaller cat and ghost portraits on either side. Finally, place two blue-flame wall sconces on each side of the portrait cluster.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 6: Create the Seating Area</h3>
            <p>
                Position the plush red high-backed armchair to the left of the fireplace. Place two round red stools in front of the fireplace, with a small circular wooden table between them. Decorate the table with white candles and a stack of colorful books.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 7: Add Musical and Spectral Characters</h3>
            <p>
                Place the purple grand piano on the upper attic platform to the right of the shingled roof, along with its matching bench. Put the musician ghost on the bench and the bunny-hugging ghost on the small bench by the window. Finally, position the three reading ghosts: one in the red armchair and two on the red stools to complete the scene.

          <h2>Dreamy Room Level 104 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
          <p>
            Dreamy Room Level 104 transports you to a whimsical forest glade. This walkthrough guides you through creating a charming scene with a grass island, floating platforms, and a cozy creature house, all surrounded by a serene water channel.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 1: Place the Base and Main Grass Platform</h3>
          <p>
            Begin by selecting the aqua-blue border base tile and aligning its curved edge with the bottom of the grid. Next, fit the large decagon-shaped green grass tile onto the left side of the base, making sure it doesn't overlap the water channel.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 2: Arrange the Cylindrical Platforms</h3>
          <p>
            Position the tallest gray cylinder at the center-back of the grass platform. Place the medium-height cylinder to its right, leaving one grid square of space. Put the shortest cylinder in the far-right corner and attach the small cuboid piece to its front-right side to create a stepped look.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 3: Position the Blue Creature House and Furniture</h3>
          <p>
            Select the shell-shaped blue house and place it slightly right of center on the grass platform, with the open facade facing forward. Inside, add the semi-circular wooden balcony and then place the miniature desk with maps and a lamp on top. Finally, position the curved sleeping nook block underneath the balcony.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 4: Add the Tree Trunk and Vining Flowers</h3>
          <p>
            Attach the brown tree trunk piece to the top of the tallest cylinder. Place the three cube-shaped foliage blocks on the trunk's branches. Wrap the twisting green vine segments around the trunk and clip the white flower clusters so they drape between the platforms.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 5: Place Birds, Nest, Flora, and Ground Props</h3>
          <p>
            Place the pale-blue bird on the left foliage cube and the pink bird on the right cube, both facing inward. Set the nest with three eggs on the topmost cube. Tuck a miniature fern cluster behind the blue house and a clover-like leaf element to the left of the grass. Finally, arrange the oversized mushroom trio, mini wooden stump seats, a hanging cauldron, a lily pad with a tiny frog, and a short wooden footbridge in the base area to complete the scene.

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 105 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>
        Dreamy Room Level 105 invites you to craft a cozy marketplace scene. This guide details every step, from placing planters and crates to assembling the shop building and arranging interior items and characters.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 1: Place Front Planters on the Raised Platform</h3>
      <p>
        Begin by selecting two terra-cotta planters filled with bright white and yellow daisies. Position one on the far left and the other on the far right edge of the raised deck, leaving space in the center for steps. Slightly inset the planters to prevent petals from overlapping the edge. Adjust rotation to ensure a balanced look.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Add Left Fence Segment and Cushion</h3>
      <p>
        Insert the small wooden fence piece with three vertical posts and two rails into the left-front corner. Place a sky-blue cushion snugly between the middle posts, forming a mini-bench. Use fine adjustments to align perfectly with the rails.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Place the Signpost</h3>
      <p>
        Select the tall wooden signpost with two directional planks. Position it at the front-left corner of the lower green base. Ensure it stands vertically and flush with the platform, adjusting rotation and nudging as needed.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4: Arrange Crate and Cardboard Boxes</h3>
      <p>
        Place the wooden crate filled with bottles and folded cloth at the deck’s center-front, slightly left of the steps. Stack three cardboard boxes to the right of the crate, spacing evenly. Rotate and nudge pieces for a neat arrangement.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5: Position Hay Bales</h3>
      <p>
        Locate two golden hay bales and place one at the back-left corner and the other at the back-right corner of the deck. Adjust positioning so they rest naturally against the shop footprint without clipping nearby elements.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6: Set the Shop Base</h3>
      <p>
        Place the pale wooden shop base in the center of the raised deck, aligning the floorboards with the deck edges. Use fine adjustments to ensure the building is balanced and flush with the platform.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7: Add Roof and Sign</h3>
      <p>
        Attach the cow-patterned roof on top of the shop base, with the blue-trimmed front facing outward. Insert the round wooden window into its slot and mount the "Go Shop" sign above the entrance. Adjust carefully to eliminate gaps or overlaps.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 8: Place Awnings</h3>
      <p>
        Clip two blue-and-white striped semi-circular awnings: one above the entrance window and another above the bench area. Ensure consistent height and overhang for symmetry.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 9: Arrange Interior Shelving and Stock</h3>
      <p>
        Install three wooden shelves along the back wall: bottom for small boxes, middle for canned goods, top for baked items. Check that shelves are level and properly stocked.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 10: Place Chiller, Counter Items, and Characters</h3>
      <p>
        Position the glass-topped chiller flush against the front ledge. Add a pastry tray, jars, and folded cloth to the counter. Finally, place the cow attendant behind the counter, the bear visitor outside, and the frog companion on the bench under its awning. This completes the lively marketplace scene.

        Position the metallic landing gear struts beneath the fuselage, three on each side angled downward. Attach two dark gray stubby wheels, one at the tail and one beneath the nose. Proper alignment ensures stability for all upper layers.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Place Bottom Deck, Bamboo Grove, and Swing</h3>
      <p>
        Install the irregular grassy green platform along the fuselage’s length. Place five segmented bamboo stalks in the left-rear corner and attach the light wooden A-frame swing at the front-center edge, ensuring ropes hang taut and avoid overlapping bamboo or struts.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4: Add Middle-Level Balcony and Side Platforms</h3>
      <p>
        Position the L-shaped pastel peach-pink balcony wrapping around the upper fuselage, leaving the front corner open for the slide. Attach two small side ledges adjacent to the bamboo cluster and front-right potted greenery. Align railings outward and ensure ledges nest flush without intersecting the lower deck.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5: Furnish Middle-Level Balcony</h3>
      <p>
        Place a compact wooden bench with powder-blue cushion on the left section, a pastel yellow side door with circular window on the right, and a low coffee table at the open front corner with two pale blue floor cushions beside it, including a small fox figurine. Add three terra-cotta pots on the wall shelf above the door and one potted plant on the right-side balcony floor.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6: Install Slide and Under-Deck Features</h3>
      <p>
        Attach the whimsical yellow slide from the middle balcony down to the grassy bottom deck. Place a bright yellow mat at the slide’s base, a round potted plant beneath the right side, and a teal countertop unit under the deck with a wicker basket, stacked plates, and tiny mixer to complete the lived-in feel.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7: Place Top-Level Turret and Finishing Touches</h3>
      <p>
        Set the pale blue circular turret on the fuselage midsection, surround it with a curved salmon railing, and insert the peach-colored arched window with pastel-blue awning. Affix a small white flag on top, place a pink tripod telescope on the left rim, and attach two decorative yellow stars to the front slope of the turret roof, completing your sky-high hideaway.

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 107 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>
        Dreamy Room Level 107 brings your space to life as a vibrant neon KTV lounge. This walkthrough covers every element from LED floor borders to character figurines, ensuring a fully immersive experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 1: Place the Neon Pink LED Floor Border</h3>
      <p>
        Begin by selecting the long curved neon pink LED strip from the lighting category. Drag it along the front edge of the checkered floor and rotate to snap perfectly along the curved back and side walls. Zoom in on corners and use grid snapping for precision. This border defines the color palette and the playable area for Dreamy Room Level 107.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Install the Neon Arrow Stripe Lights on the Curved Back Wall</h3>
      <p>
        Select the neon arrow stripe asset from the decorations menu. Place two stripes framing each side of the curved back wall, roughly one meter from each corner, with tips angled inward toward the marquee. Use duplication and grid snapping to ensure symmetry and consistent alignment in Dreamy Room Level 107.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Mount the KTV Marquee Sign with Star and Microphone atop the Stage Area</h3>
      <p>
        From the signage tab, select the KTV neon sign with light blue lettering on black backing. Position it at the upper-left arc of the curved wall, just above eye level. Add the yellow star background behind it and center the microphone atop the star, slightly angled forward to catch the spotlights. Verify glow and positioning for Dreamy Room Level 107.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4: Position the Stage Platform and Arrange Overhead Spotlights</h3>
      <p>
        Select the red-carpeted stage platform and snap it into the left corner where the curved and side walls meet. Choose golden spotlight fixtures and place four evenly spaced: two above the platform on the curved wall and two on the side wall. Adjust angles so beams converge at the stage center. Fine-tune rotation and zoom for natural spotlight effects in Dreamy Room Level 107.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5: Place the Large Speakers and Compact Purple Monitors</h3>
      <p>
        Select two tall black floor speakers, positioning one on each side of the stage equidistant from the edges. Then, select two small purple cube monitors and place them against the curved and side walls flanking the platform. Angle speaker grills slightly inward and use grid view to verify height and spacing for optimal sound in Dreamy Room Level 107.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6: Add Game Screens, Hazard Stripe Backdrop, and Vertical Neon Panels</h3>
      <p>
        Place horizontal flat screens above the left and right areas of the stage, securing them to the walls. Add a black and pink diagonal hazard stripe board behind the right screen for contrast. Finally, install two tall yellow vertical neon panels on each side wall to frame the seating area. Align each element upright using rotation tools to maintain visual clarity in Dreamy Room Level 107.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7: Place the Plush Red Tufted Couch along the Right Wall</h3>
      <p>
        Select the red tufted sectional sofa and drag it into the right corner, aligning back cushions with the wall seams. Use fine movement controls to nudge and avoid clipping the neon floor border. This couch anchors the seating area and ensures comfortable lounge flow in Dreamy Room Level 107.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 8: Add Tables, Purple Lamps, and Refreshments</h3>
      <p>
        Position a black rectangular coffee table centrally in front of the couch, with wooden side tables at each sofa end. Place translucent purple cylinder lamps atop the side tables. Finally, add a bowl of fruit, bottles, and cocktail glasses on the coffee table for a balanced and inviting social setup in Dreamy Room Level 107.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 9: Position Character Figurines and Mount the Deer Head Decor</h3>
      <p>
        Place the singing white bunny figurine at the center of the stage. Arrange the pink tutu bunny and relaxed raccoon along the right armrest of the couch, and the orange fox at the left edge for balance. Mount the stylized deer head sculpture above the right seating area. Verify alignment and spacing to finalize the personalized decor in Dreamy Room Level 107.

      <h2>Dreamy Room Level 108 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>
        Dreamy Room Level 108 transforms your space into a cozy winter wonderland snow globe. This walkthrough details each tier, from the central red base platform to whimsical winter decorations across the top, middle, and lower layers.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 1: Place the Red Base Platform in the Center</h3>
      <p>
        Begin by laying down the large circular red base platform with golden snowflake patterns at the exact center of the scene. Ensure it sits flush with the bottom edge of the screen to create a stable foundation for all subsequent elements in Dreamy Room Level 108. Adjust positioning carefully for balance.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Add the White Drippy Snow Cap</h3>
      <p>
        Place the sculpted white drippy snow cap atop the red base, aligning each icicle-like drip around the circumference. Ensure a seamless connection between the snow and base, reinforcing the realistic winter effect in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Seal the Scene with the Transparent Glass Dome</h3>
      <p>
        Lower the clear glass dome over the base and snow cap, ensuring the rim seats flush without tilting. The dome’s bluish tint and subtle snowflake etchings encapsulate the winter scene, maintaining symmetry in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4: Arrange Snowy Pine Trees and Log Pile on the Top Tier</h3>
      <p>
        Place three snow-covered evergreen pine trees in a semicircular pattern at the rear of the top tier. Position a small stack of logs to the left of the center tree, creating a cohesive winter forest backdrop for Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5: Set Up the Campsite Tent, Tripod Cauldron, and Nearby Bucket</h3>
      <p>
        Position a small wooden A-frame tent in front of the pine trees. Add a tripod cooking stand with hanging cauldron to the right, including a tiny campfire icon beneath. Place a yellow bucket to the left, arranging all items to form a realistic campsite vignette in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6: Ignite the Campfire and Add Lanterns</h3>
      <p>
        Activate the campfire directly in front of the cooking area. Place a pair of lanterns on either side to create a soft amber glow, carefully adjusting angles to maintain clear separation and enhance the cozy atmosphere in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7: Place the Wooden Signpost and Top-Tier Snowman</h3>
      <p>
        Insert a slender wooden signpost slightly angled toward the front next to the tent. Position a three-tiered snowman at the far right of the top tier, adding a tiny red hat and coal buttons to complete the whimsical upper vignette in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 8: Position the Decorative Stall Base and Railing on the Middle Tier</h3>
      <p>
        Place the rectangular wooden market stall with red-and-white striped awning centrally on the middle tier. Add short wooden railing posts around the perimeter, spacing evenly to create a protective border, maintaining symmetry and scale in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 9: Add the Grill, Teapot, and Colorful Mugs to the Market Stall</h3>
      <p>
        Place a miniature metal grill at the center of the stall. Add a rounded teapot slightly off-center and two or three colorful mugs along the front edge, ensuring each piece stands independently for clarity in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 10: Place Wooden Chairs and Connecting Ladder on the Middle Tier</h3>
      <p>
        Position two folding wooden chairs on either side of the grill, angled slightly inward. Add a tall wooden ladder linking the middle tier to the top campsite, ensuring the base rests firmly on the snow layer. Maintain alignment for immersive gameplay in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 11: Add the Skiing Penguin Figure on the Middle-Right Slope</h3>
      <p>
        Place the penguin figurine with purple beanie on skis along the middle-right snow ramp, facing forward and positioned just below the ladder midpoint. Adjust angles to avoid overlapping railings or grill elements in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 12: Position the Bench, Reindeer, and Sleigh on the Lower Tier</h3>
      <p>
        Place a slender wooden bench on the left side of the lower tier. Situate a small reindeer figure in front, slightly turned toward center. Position a deep red sleigh behind the reindeer with runners touching the snow, ensuring spacing feels balanced in Dreamy Room Level 108.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 13: Add Snowmen, Polar Bear, Decorative Bush, Lamp Post, and Anchor</h3>
      <p>
        Place two snowmen: one wearing a purple hat near the bench, another reclining with a blue cap in the middle. Add a white polar bear with blue beret beside the second snowman, a small pine bush behind it, and finally a twin-lantern lamp post with metal anchor on the far right. Verify natural placement to complete Dreamy Room Level 108.
