          <h2>Dreamy Room Level 101 Solution Walkthrough</h2>
          <p>
            Dreamy Room Level 101 pushes your precision and spatial awareness to the next level. Starting on a bare sandy platform, 
            you’ll place palm trees, desert cacti, structural panels, and decorative accents to bring this desert-themed restaurant to life. 
            Each step focuses on correct snap-point orientation, ensuring every object clicks into place with satisfying accuracy.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 1: Palm Trees on Platform Edges</h3>
          <p>
            Begin with two palm trees positioned at opposite corners of the base. Rotate the camera to align trunks with the 
            subtle platform contours and listen for the snap sound confirming placement.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 2: Cacti Cluster</h3>
          <p>
            Distribute the perimeter cacti along designated notches. Alternate tall and short pieces to achieve a natural desert cluster effect.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 3: Central Pyramid Roof</h3>
          <p>
            Place the yellow-topped pyramid roof piece at the center notch of the platform, ensuring all corners align flush.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 4: Glass Window Facade</h3>
          <p>
            Insert the tall green-tinted glass panel into the west wall notch, locking it firmly into the base structure.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 5: Restaurant Sign & Emblem</h3>
          <p>
            Attach the fork-and-knife emblem above the entrance and secure the “Restaurant” script plaque in the front groove.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 6: Egyptian-Style Pillars</h3>
          <p>
            Position two ornate columns at the counter’s front corners. Rotate each to face inward for a balanced visual effect.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 7: Counter, Stools & Items</h3>
          <p>
            Place the red-and-white counter under the sign, then add two yellow bar stools and three countertop items: 
            a coffee cup, burger plate, and orange juice tumbler.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 8: Outdoor Table & Chairs</h3>
          <p>
            Snap the pink patio table into the terrace notch and surround it with four red chairs angled correctly for a lively dining scene.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 9: Staircase, Vending Machine & Extras</h3>
          <p>
            Align the staircase and adjacent red vending machine on the east face, then place the mummy figurine and fruit crate nearby.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 10: Rooftop Sphinx Ornament</h3>
          <p>
            For the finishing touch, install the black-and-yellow sphinx ornament on the pyramid’s roof apex, completing your desert-inspired eatery.
